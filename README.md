MIS Final Project

Steps for using app:

As we have only used gyroscope for implementing the project the placement of the phone needs to be proper:
- Sit straight in a comfortable position
-  Place the device on your chest, screen facing upwards. The device should be in an angle of 75-85 degrees approximately.
- Once you have placed the device properly, press the start button and say stationery. 
- You can see the graph as the device is reading and processing the data.
(The readings on the graph should be around 7). 
- After a minute you would be able to know the breathing rate.
